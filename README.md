# app-tractographyQualityCheck
This app computes a number of statistics about your [input tractogram](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5907d922436ee50ffde9c549) and any (optionally input) **associated** [White Matter Classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  These statistics can be used to facilitate quality assurance on your tractography and segmentation, or as part of subject/group level quantative analysis for a research project.  See the output section for a detailed description of the measures computed.

## Running the App 

### Inputs

### On Brainlife.io

Visit [this site](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.189) to run this app on the brainlife.io platform.  Minimally requires a [tractogram](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5907d922436ee50ffde9c549).  Can also be augmented with a [LiFE input](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844) and/or a [White Matter Classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) object to perform statistical analyes relevant to the [LiFE fit](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnmeth.3098) and/or [segmentation](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).

### Running Locally (on your machine) using singularity & docker

Because this is compiled code which runs on singularity, you can download the repo and run it locally with minimal setup.  

### Running Locally (on your machine)

Pull the [WMA toolkit repo](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools)

Ensure that the packages listed under 'adding paths' are avaialble on your local environment.

Run: [this function](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/master/bsc_feAndSegQualityCheck_BL_v2.m), but take care to ensure that the addpath-genpath statements are relevant to your local setup.

Utilize a config.json setup that is analagous to the one contained within this repo, listed as a sample.

### Sample Datasets

Visit brainlife.io and explore the following data sets to find viable classification and tractography inputs:

[HCP classificaiton](https://brainlife.io/project/5c3caea0a6747b0036dcbf9a/)

\*endpoint membership in either the left/inferior/posterior-most (LIP) or right/superior/anterior-most (RAS) group is determined by the following process:

1. computing the primary dimension of traversal for a tract (i.e. left-right, inferior-superior, anterior-posterior) by determining which dimension exhibits the greatest displacement for the given tract.
2. Once this dimension has been determined, the relevant coordinates (x, y, or z) of the streamline&#39;s endpoints are checked to determine determine LIP or RAS membership

An svg image output from the [quality check app](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.189) with the following plots:

| **Figure title** | **X axis quantity** | **Y axis quantity** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| &quot;Normalized WBFG &amp; NonZero Weighted Stream Count Comparison&quot; | streamline length (in mm) | whole brain proportion of the streamline count | This plot depicts the proportion of streamlines (out of all those in the whole brain fiber group) that are of a certain length. The dark blue line corresponds to the input whole brain tractogram, while the light blue line corresponds to the line of best fit using an exponential model (y=a^(b\*x)).  The relevant parameters can be noted in the grey column on the left. |
| &quot;Cumulative proportion of fibers in connectome, by length&quot; | streamline length (in mm) | total proportion of streamlines | This plot depicts the total proportion of streamlines that are equal to or less than the specified length. |
| &quot;Classified Streamline proportion Comparison:  WBFG &amp; Surviving&quot; | streamline length (in mm) | total proportion of classified streamlines | Similar to the first plot, but only computes proportions for classified streamlines.  Proportion is relative to all classified streamlines. |
| &quot;Log10 of proportion of connectome streamlines in tract&quot; | tract names | log10 of the percentage of the total number of streamlines in whole brain fiber group | For all identified tracts in the input white matter classification (WMC) structure this plot indicates the percentage (scaled in log10) of all streamlines in the whole brain fiber group that are associated with this specific tract.For tracts which have left and right variants, left is plotted in blue and right is plotted in orange.  For tracts which do not have left and right variants (i.e. are interhemispheric) the default color is blue. |
| &quot;Proportion of white matter volume occupied by tract&quot; | tract names | Portion of white matter occupied (by percent) | For all identified tracts in the input white matter classification (WMC) structure this plot indicates the percentage of the total white matter volume occupied by each respective tract. For tracts which have left and right variants, left is plotted in blue and right is plotted in orange.  For tracts which do not have left and right variants (i.e. are interhemispheric) the default color is blue. |



[**raw, quantative output**](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cb7711c44947d8aea8cb4f4)

A tiered, field based .mat structure with the metrics included in the **tractmeasures.csv** , along with additional metrics.  Generated as an output from the [quality check app](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.189).  Below the metrics **not** included in the **tractmeasures.csv** are described.

Note:  statistics listed immediately below are those within the field contents of results.WBFG and are specific to the associated whole brain fiber group, and are thus **computed across all streamlines in the associated**** whole brain fiber group**.  The exception is the tractStats field, which will be described in a separate table immediately following this one.

| **Fieldname (within results.WBFG)** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| avgefficiencyRat(average efficiency ratio) | This quantity is the _average efficiency ratio_ for all streamlines in the entire whole brain fiber group.  For a given streamline this is computed by dividing the streamline&#39;s _displacement_ (see description in tractmeasures.csv section) by that same streamline&#39;s length.  Thus this value approaches 1 as a streamline approaches being shaped like a straight line, and approaches 0 as a streamline approaches being shaped like a full circuit. |
|   | [Code Link](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/498706fb662a0af8ad431f297d8e2fd548fcca56/Analysis/ConnectomeTestQ_v2.m#L49) |
| stDevefficiencyRat(standard deviation of efficiency ratio) | This quantity is the _standard deviation of the efficiency ratio_ for all streamlines in the entire whole brain fiber group. |
|   | [Code Link](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/498706fb662a0af8ad431f297d8e2fd548fcca56/Analysis/wma_quantTract.m#L71) |
| avgAsymRat(average asymmetry ratio) | This quantity is the _average asymmetry ratio_ for all streamlines in the entire whole brain fiber group.  In essence, for a given streamline, it is the square of the differences between the efficiency ratios for the respective halves of a streamline.  Thus, as a streamline&#39;s _asymmetry ratio_ approaches the maximum of 1, it indicates that one half has an efficiency ratio of 0, and resembles a full circuit, while the other half has an efficiency ratio of 1 and resembles a straight line.  On the other hand, as a streamline's _asymmetry ratio_ approaches the minimum of 0, the difference between the two halves' efficiency ratios approach 0, and are thus presumed to more closely resemble one another, at least within the domain of wiring efficiency. |

Note:  statistics listed immediately below are those within the field contents of results.WBFG.tractStats{1,i}, where i corresponds the tract specified in the ith entry in the classification.names field of the associated classification structure.  The quantifications described below are specific to their associated tract.  Omitted from these descriptions are quantifications which have been described either for the **tractmeasures.csv** data object or the results.WBFG field.  In cases where the quantification has previously been described within the context of a measurement of a whole brain fiber group, the quantification is to be understood to represent the same general concept, but to characterize a specific tract in these cases.
